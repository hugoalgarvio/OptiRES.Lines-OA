1. Prerequisites for Deployment 

. Verify the MATLAB runtime is installed and ensure you    
  have installed version 8.5 (R2015a).   

. If the MATLAB runtime is not installed, do the following:
  (1) enter
  
      >>mcrinstaller
      
      at MATLAB prompt. The MCRINSTALLER command displays the 
      location of the MATLAB runtime installer.

  (2) run the MATLAB runtime installer.

Or download the Windows 64-bit version of the MATLAB runtime for R2015a 
from the MathWorks Web site by navigating to

   http://www.mathworks.com/products/compiler/mcr/index.html
   
   
For more information about the MATLAB runtime and the MATLAB runtime installer, see 
Package and Distribute in the MATLAB Compiler documentation  
in the MathWorks Documentation Center.    


NOTE: You will need administrator rights to run MCRInstaller.
